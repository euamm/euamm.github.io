    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. It is very much a work in progress. As I slowly learn how to build it you can expect some unintentional simplicity and brokenness. </p>
    
    <p>If you would like to read more about me and my plans for this website please head over to the <a href="about.html" class="in_text_link" >about page</a>.</p>
    
    <p>If you are looking for content that others have taken the time to create, have made freely available and have been useful to me in my learning journey then please head over to the <a href="resources.html" class="in_text_link" >resources page</a>.</p>

    <p>For some words I felt the need to write at one point in time, head over to <a href="blog.html" class="in_text_link" >my blog</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are looking to contact me or would like to check out the other places across the web where I can be found, then please head over to my <a href="contact.html" class="in_text_link" >contact page</a>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting and I hope to see you here again soon, 
    <br><br>
