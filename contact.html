    <h2>Where To Contact Me</h2>
    
    <p>Does something on the site not work? Is something out of date? Have you got any suggestions to improve the site? For example, could the site be more accessible?</p>
    
    <p>For any of the reasons above and just about anything else, please feel free to contact me. I am currently active on, and will do my very best to respond to you using the options below.</p>
    
    <h3>Mastadon</h3> 
    
    <p>I have only recently joined Mastadon and it is indeed my first venture into the 'fediverse'. If you are not on Mastadon
      or have yet to learn about the 'fediverse' I would highly recommend doing so. So far, everyone on the platform has
      been very welcoming. You can head over to my Mastodon profile by <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@euanm">clicking here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>GitHub</h3>

    <p>GitHub is a large platform for managing and sharing code. The code for this website is available on GitHub 
    and as I get further on my journey with Python I will also start keeping Python projects on there too. Also, 
    if you notice any errors or room for improvement, GitHub is a great place to suggest or make these edits. You can check out
    my GitHub profile by <a href="https://github.com/euamm" rel="me">clicking here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Form</h3>

    <p>One of the next steps on my internet journey is trying to find a good back-end process to recieve internet forms so that
      people without access to the other options above can contact me via the form.</p>
