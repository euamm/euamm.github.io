# euamm.github.io

I plan for this to be my personal wesbite for all things medicine, data, open access and open source.
It will also be a bit of a personal project as I currently have very little web experience and will therefore be adding/taking away from it as I go along the learning journey.
Excited to see where my journey with both the content that I hope to have on the site and the building of the actual site take me.
